# Rock'em Sock'em Robots

My project is a version of the 1964 game Rock’em Sock’em Robots.


## Why:
I am just now wrapping up another project called Javascript Pixel Art, and I thought it would be a cool idea to create a pixelized version of the Rock’em Sock’em Robots game.


## Gameplay:
The player will use the arrow keys on the keyboard to punch. There will be a damage meter to track how much life is left, and when it is zero, the head of the opponent will pop off - just like in the real game. Chuck Norris quotes will be displayed during gameplay to provide commentary on your progress.


## Features:
1. Player can punch.
2. Damage meter to track how much life is left.
3. When damage is at zero, head pops off.
4. Practice mode. Player one vs dummy that doesn’t move.
5. API calls for Chuck Norris quotes to display after different actions in the game.


## Future Features:
1. One player vs computer. The computer is Chuck Norris that you play against.
2. Computer randomly generates moves (punches).
3. Three levels of difficulty: Easy, medium, and ludicrous speed (hard).
4. Two player mode where you can play against another player.


## Technologies:
* Materialize for the front-end
* HTML, CSS, Plain old Javascript
* Pixi.js for animations, and Matter.js for the physics engine
* jQuery to make AJAX calls to API
